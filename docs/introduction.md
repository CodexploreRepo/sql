# SQL Introduction

## 1. Introduction
### What is the Database ?
- A database is a way of organizing data such that you can perform four operations on it
  - create
  - read
  - update
  - delete
- A database management system (DBMS) is a way to interact with a database using a graphical interface or textual language.
  - Examples of DBMS: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft Access, MongoDB etc.
- The choice of a DBMS would rest on factors like
  - **Cost**: proprietary vs. free software,
  - **Amount of support**: free and open source software like MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite come with the downside of having to set up the database yourself,
  - **Weight**: more fully-featured systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL are heavier and require more computation to run than systems like SQLite.
### SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to interact with databases, via which you can create, read, update, and delete data in a database. Some important notes about SQL
  - it is structured, as we’ll see in this course,
  - it has some keywords that can be used to interact with the database, and
  - it is a query language — it can be used to ask questions of data inside a database.
