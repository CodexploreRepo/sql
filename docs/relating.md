# Relating

## Entity Relationship Diagrams
- There are one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between tables in a database.
- It is possible to visualize such relationships using an **entity relationship (ER)** diagram.
  - Each table is an entity in our database. The relationships between the tables, or entities, are represented by the verbs that mark the lines connecting entities.

- *Example of ER diagram*:
  - Ex 1: an author writes at least one book and a book is written by at least one author.

## Keys
### Primary Keys
- **Primary key** is an identifier that is unique for every item in a table.
- For example: in the case of books, every book has a unique identifier called an ISBN

### Foreign Keys
- **Foreign key** is a primary key taken from a different table. By referencing the primary key of a different table, it helps relate the tables by forming a link between them.
  - For example: primary key of the `books` table is now a column in the `ratings` table.
    - This helps form a one-to-many relationship between the two tables â€” a book with a title (found in the `books` table) can have multiple ratings (found in the `ratings` table).
